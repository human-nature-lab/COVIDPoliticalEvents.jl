## Additional model details and diagnostics

We present the extended diagnostic plots and estimates for each model presented in the paper, including the pre-refinement covariate balance and estimates, and the balances and estimates for each model without application of calipers. We note that, in each post-refinement caliper model presented, we obtain sufficient covariate balance to estimate the ATT reliably, with scores below the 0.1 standardized balance score threshold (as described in Methods). Moreover, the post-refinement estimates typically improve balance greatly over models using the full set of matched units. For the omnibus death and case rate models, see Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3. For the primary election overall and turnout-stratified estimates, see Supplementary Figs. [-@fig-s6; -@fig-s7; -@fig-s8; -@fig-s55] and Extended Data Fig. 4. For the GA election, see Supplementary Figs. [-@fig-s9] and Extended Data Fig. 5. For the NJ and VA elections, see Supplementary Figs. [-@fig-s12] and Extended Data Fig. 6. For Donald Trump’s political rallies, which include estimates and covariate balance for each exposure level, see Supplementary Figs. [-@fig-s13; -@fig-s14] and Extended Data Figs. 7-8. For the Black Lives Matter protests, see Supplementary Figs. [-@fig-s15; -@fig-s16; -@fig-s17; -@fig-s61; -@fig-s62] and Extended Data Fig. 9. Further, we include results and diagnostic for the estimate of the ATT for the death count (@fig-s63).

Similarly, we also examined the ATTs for an estimates of the effective reproduction number ($R_t$) from a recent approach in the literature [@chitwood_reconstructing_2022] (Fig. 7), with model diagnostics presented in Supplementary Figs. [-@fig-s64; -@fig-s65; -@fig-s66; -@fig-s67; -@fig-s68; -@fig-s69]. Additionally, we include a display of the distributions of the number of matches, to summarize the number of matches used in the refined caliper model (@fig-s70).

Note that the case rate models examine a longer outcome window, relative to the first-wave of cases expected from an exogenous shock to the epidemic curve; one meaningful limitation of our death rate models is that we may likely only capture the first-wave deaths that occur from first-hand transmission from infectives at the "treatment" event. The case rate and $R_t$ models may additionally capture second-wave effects from the treatment, i.e., transmission to someone not present at the treatment event from someone present. Consequently, the case rate models bolster our confidence that there is no meaningful effect of the political events examined herein.

As a further diagnostic assessment, we have also included the ATT estimates for the case and death rate analyses presented in the main text. These estimates include the matching period, and the period between the event and the start of the outcome window (on day 10). As expected, the ATTs yield generally non-significant results in the period leading up to the outcome window. The intervals and effect sizes mirror those for the estimates over the outcome windows themselves. The results are reported in Extended Data Fig. 1.

## Robustness checks

### Additional models

We examine an additional set of models to ensure that the finding of no-effect is consistent across different stratifications of the treated units. For the primary election, we calculated models that stratify on the population density (Supplementary Figs. [-@fig-s18; -@fig-s19]); the date of the primary election, which include primary elections as early as March 3, 2020 excluded from the other models ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s20; -@fig-s21]); the US Census region of the US (e.g. New England) ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s22; -@fig-s23]); Donald Trump’s share of the vote in 2016 ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s24; -@fig-s25]); the number of days since the primary election to the first reported case in a county ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s26; -@fig-s27]); the cumulative case rate at the time of treatment ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s28; -@fig-s29]); and the cumulative death rate at the time of treatment ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s30; -@fig-s31]). These assessments are consistent with our primary results.

For the GA elections, additional models that stratified by in-person voter turnout do not reveal differences conditional on these levels in the ATTs as the turnout rate increases ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s33; -@fig-s34]). Moreover, an additional analysis that stratified by tendency to wear masks rarely or never found that the modest impact of the election on subsequent local COVID-19 mortality diminishes in counties where the tendency to wear masks rarely or never is below the median for Georgia counties (that is, in counties where, perhaps, people were more likely to obey masking and social distancing recommendations) ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s35; -@fig-s36]). Finally, a similar effect is observed in an analysis that stratified by above or below 50% vote share for Donald Trump in the 2016 election, where a similar pattern is observed ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s37; -@fig-s38]).

With respect to the Donald Trump rallies, we stratified by Trump’s share of the vote and the treatment exposure level; we supposed that counties that had a majority vote for Trump would be more likely to contain rally attendees and possess a greater likelihood of rally-induced transmission. In each stratum, we found no positive and significant pattern over the outcome window ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s39; -@fig-s42]).

Finally, for the BLM protests, we found no effect in an additional model that stratified treated observations based on the number of recent protests (that totaled above 1,000 persons) that occurred within the three weeks prior to the focal protest ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s43; -@fig-s44]).

### Potential endogeneity of the primary elections

The US primary elections unfold every four years according to a predetermined and idiosyncratic schedule. Experimental designs require that the treatment is assigned to units at random; this condition does not straightforwardly hold when elections occur at different times with respect to the COVID-19 epidemic trajectory and the characteristics of states are not balanced over time (e.g., earlier states in the primary schedule tend to be less representative of the US)[@medina_nevada_2021]. Moreover, in the 2020 elections, many primaries were cancelled or rescheduled due to COVID-19 (Supplementary Table 1), implying that the treatment might possibly be endogenous to the epidemic. Consequently, it may be argued that we only observed primary elections that occurred when they were rescheduled to "safer" dates. However, we explored the difference in cumulative death and case rates for each election that was rescheduled, and we observes that there were no meaningful differences in the death and case rates between the originally scheduled and rescheduled dates (@fig-s2-s3). And the other elections (GA, NJ, VA) were held on their originally planned date and were not rescheduled due to COVID.

We selected our events by type, rather than by size. That is, we included an event regardless of its size, if it fell under our selected event types. The only exception is the BLM protest scenario, where we limited our set of events to events above 800 persons (see Methods). This was mainly to ensure that our estimates would not be artificially decreased by events that are very small in scale and epidemiologically irrelevant (e.g., 10 persons standing outside on a street corner may register as an event in our full dataset). Extended Data Fig. 10 displays the timeline and sizes of the political events.

While the rallies and protests were scheduled during COVID, and endogeneity cannot be ruled out entirely, both were held over significant phases of the epidemic. Donald Trump’s rallies, in particular, were criticized for having large attendance during COVID spikes[@peters_trump_2020]. To more clearly demonstrate that bias due to attendance does not seem to be a meaningful problem in our analysis, we executed a set of regression models, which show that the cumulative death rate and case rates are either not significant or are negligibly small in magnitude as predictors of event size, in models that adjust for event type, and a host of county-level characteristics (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). The model for the death rate with the most extensive set of controls, including interactions between event type and death rate and between event type and Trump’s share of the vote in 2016, yields a significant coefficient of -4.348e-03 (P = 8.08e-05), implying that, ceteris paribus, a one unit increase in the death rate (per 100K individuals) is associated with a less than 1% decrease in an event’s size, which we consider to be very small effect in the context of events which are frequently thousands of persons in size. The model with the most extensive set of controls for the case rate yields a non-significant coefficient of 7.068e-06 (P = 0.870295), implying a one unit increase in the case rate (per 100K individuals) is associated with a less than 1% increase in the size of an event (another simplified model yields a significant coefficient of about the same magnitude; cf. Supplementary Table 4). Similar results hold for logistic models that regress on whether an event is held or not, using all county data across the US on the same day, and controlling for a host of characteristics (Supplementary Table 5).

Furthermore, we find that explicitly stratifying on the turnout rate and protest size does not change our null result: analyses that stratify on the in-person turnout rate for the elections (Fig. 3) and the size of the protest event (Fig. 6) do not exhibit significant effects. Similarly, results that stratify on the cumulative case and death rates at the time of the primary election ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s28; -@fig-s30]) yield no meaningful effects. Furthermore, the included events comprise around 7% (mean = 0.073, SD = 0.08) of the county population on average, across all events, indicating that they were sizeable portions of each county. 

However, more generally, our method avoids potential bias that could stem from an endogeneity in turnout to COVID severity by matching counties based on characteristics of the epidemic (the death or case rate or transmissibility in the period leading up to the event along with the date of the first reported case). While it is true that low attendance in counties with higher rates of COVID might have reduced transmission, we see this a possible effect modifier, which does not bias the results. Finally, the difference in death rates between treated and not treated counties on the day of a political event tended to be very small, at a difference of 0.776 per million persons, indicating that the timing and locations of events was not unusual with respect to the epidemic in general.

###	Treatment-associated mobility

We applied our generalized difference-in-differences approach to our mobility variables (Fig. 8), and found no significant effect of political events on mobility in a period from 0 to 20 days after a large-scale political event. These models were matched with the same set of covariates as the overall estimates for each event type, using cumulative death rate as the epidemiological for matching.
Furthermore, we descriptively examined the mobility trends of treated units during a period of 14 days prior to 14 days after treatment, for five place types that have been previously identified as potential sources of COVID-19 transmission[@chang_mobility_2021]: drinking places, fitness and recreational sports centers, religious organizations, full-service restaurants, and grocers ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s45; -@fig-s48]). We exclude drinking places because SafeGraph does not comprehensively track this business type, and we exclude religious organizations because they are often used as polling places (and hence visitation is at least partly determined by the election treatments). 

For the primary elections, @fig-s47 presents the county-level average mobility in terms of aggregate visits, per ten-thousand persons, to each place type, for each relevant state. We observed that there is no apparent increase in visitation, on average, associated with each place type. @fig-s48 presents the county-level average around the Georgia special election, which similarly indicates no mobility spike associated with the election. @fig-s45 presents the average for each treatment exposure level to Donald Trump’s rallies, indicating no clear spike in mobility. Finally, @fig-s46 gives the US county-average for treated counties, also indicating no clear increase in mobility during the BLM protests.

###	Alternative covariate specifications

As an additional check on the robustness of our covariate specifications, we have included additional versions of the main analyses with different covariates specifications. For the omnibus and primary analysis, two further covariate specifications are included beyond the full set of covariates (used for the main analysis): a "no mobility" specification that drops the mobility covariates, and a simplified, "epi" specification that matches on key epidemiological covariates: the cumulative death rate, the date of the first reported case, and the population density (and the propensity to wear a mask in scenarios except the omnibus and the primary elections). For the rest of the scenarios analyzed, we present the simplified epidemiological specifications. We present results for the omnibus analysis ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s73; -@fig-s74; -@fig-s75; -@fig-s76]), the primary elections ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s77; -@fig-s78; -@fig-s79; -@fig-s80]), the GA Special Election ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s81; -@fig-s82]), the Gubernatorial Election ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s84; -@fig-s85]), the Trump Rallies ([Supplementary Figs.  -@fig-s86; -@fig-s87]), and the BLM Protests ([Supplementary Figs. -@fig-s88; -@fig-s89]) for the death and case rates. Additionally, we have added an additional analysis of the GA special election that includes mobility at full-service restaurants – in which no major changes to the results in our main analysis ([@fig-s83]). 

These results are broadly consistent with the results in the main analyses, and in each reported variation, the overall coefficient does not rise to the level of significance at the 5% level.

###	Caliper sensitivity

We performed sensitivity checks on the caliper thresholding procedure to examine changes in the overall ATT and confidence intervals as impose tighter tolerances on the calipers (see Methods) are imposed. These calipers are important since they play a key role in determining match quality. The estimates we present in the main paper are "refined caliper" estimates. They are those where, at most, the five best matches are used for a treated county. Fewer matches are used when the average standardized balance score for any included covariate is above 0.1, and treated observations are dropped when they do not have at least one acceptable match. "Caliper" estimates are those where the caliper is applied, but as many acceptable matches as can be found are used (see Methods).

In the matching literature, 0.25 is considered a typical caliper tolerance[@austin_optimal_2011; @cochran_controlling_1973; @rosenbaum_constructing_1985]; however, narrow calipers reduce bias and improve balance, although at the expense of losing a greater number of treated observations (which cannot be matched)[@lunt_selecting_2014]. Consequently, we herein consider a range of caliper widths. We successively narrow the caliper on cumulative death rate for a possible match to 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025, and 0.01, and calculate the overall ATT, confidence intervals, and Bayes Factor at each width.

We consider two scenarios in analyzing the death rate: the omnibus model and the GA special election. We consider three covariate specifications for the omnibus model, the full set of covariates (used for the main analysis), one that drops the mobility covariates, and a simplified specification that matches on key epidemiological covariates: the cumulative death rate, the date of the first reported case, and the population density (Supplementary Tables 6-8). In each case, we observe that the number of available treated observations and matches drops (as expected), but the ATT remains stable as a very small, negative in sign, and insignificant, as we narrow the caliper.

In the no-mobility specification, the estimate remains insignificant but changes in magnitude (Supplementary Table 9). No acceptable matches are found when we restrict the caliper to 0.01, and only 24, out of 159 counties in the state of Georgia remain (with 37 matches) at a caliper of 0.025 where ATT magnitude is 0.158. However, the estimate is at 0.078 with from 80 counties at a width of 0.05. In the simplified "epi" specification (Supplementary Table 10), the estimates likewise remain insignificant, but consistently decrease in magnitude: the ATT drops from 0.138 down to 0.009 in the most restrictive model. The estimate drops to < 0.09 when we impose width of 0.05 and 0.025, which respectively leaves 132 and 81 treated counties with acceptable matches (and is similar to the result for the no-mobility specification).

###	Sensitivity testing of the null results

To give a full sense of the nature of our results, we offer two additional analyses to the usual post hoc observed power calculations. First, we use the Bayes Factor (BF) to quantify the evidence for the null relative to the alternative hypothesis. Here, we present Bayes Factors for the summary results in the main paper, and their calculation is noted in the Supplementary Methods. In general, the Bayes Factor calculations indicate that there is evidence for the truth of the null hypothesis: BF = 0.027 for the omnibus analysis of the death rate, and 0.034 for the case rate analysis. For the primary elections, BF =  0.037 and 0.038 for the death and case rates respectively. For the GA special election, BF =  0.138 and 0.104; 2.5431 (for the small, negative estimate) and 0.2965 for NJ & VA gubernatorial elections; 0.0481 and 0.0470 for the Trump rallies; and 0.0580 and 0.1051 for the BLM protests. For the transmissibility models, the BF = 0.050, 0.256, 0.213, 0.48, 0.070 for the primaries, GA special election, gubernatorial elections, Trump rallies, and BLM protests, respectively.

Second, we conduct simulations to demonstrate the ability of our analysis strategy to detect a true positive result for each scenario: the omnibus analysis, primary elections, GA special election, NJ and VA gubernatorial elections, BLM protests, and Trump rallies. We simulate the effect of an increase in the death rate over the matched controls on each day of the outcome window. We do this using the refined caliper models, i.e., the models used for our primary analyses where the set of, at most, five best matches are used for a treated county (see Methods, pp. 31-34). Specifically, we take the set of best matches and simulate a true effect of treatment for the treated units, over their matched controls, on each day of the outcome window. The effect is drawn from a normal distribution, repeated with 1,000 iterations. The mean of the distribution is the simulated ATT, and the standard deviation is the standard deviation of the outcome variable in the whole population (0.27 for the death rate per 10K persons). In the omnibus analysis, we find that we have over 80% power to detect an average increase of < 0.03, corresponding to a very small, in substantive terms, increase of less than 3 deaths per million people. Across the other scenarios, we can detect sizes of 0.03, 0.09, 0.07, 0.1, and 0.05 for the primaries, GA special election, NJ and VA gubernatorial, Trump rallies, and the BLM protests, respectively, with 80% power. We note that, as expected, the power to detect is directly related to the number of events included in each scenario, which are particularly small in the case of the Trump rallies (fewer than 70 events). Consequently, we believe that our approach can detect small magnitudes so as to detect an epidemiologically relevant effect.

Each metric is on average, over all of the treated observations. The percentage change in the total tests is calculated using the 10th day as the baseline, for each subsequent day in the 10-40 day outcome window defined after an event. Since county-level testing data were not available for our study period, we relied on state-level aggregated values[@dong_johns_2022]. As a result, the corresponding state-level value was used for the county of a given treatment event. We observe a clear and sharp increase in the number of tests conducted in the period following a political event, reflecting the fact that many events occurred during a rapid ramp-up in testing in the US. Further, given the fact that 66% of registered voters reported that they were very or somewhat concerned about the safety of voting in-person[@sabin_2_2020], it seems likely that testing is endogenous to the treatment, where individuals could have been more likely to get tested, as a result of concerns about voting, or another large-scale political gathering. Together, these considerations cast further doubt on the reliability of testing data in comparison to our mortality and transmissibility outcomes.](plotting/figures_supporting/s1.svg){#fig-s1}

![Spillover effects in Donald Trump’s rallies. The analysis of Donald Trump’s rallies considers the possibility of spillover effects; those who attend rallies in a given county may come from surrounding counties, and spread infection in their home counties, rather than or in addition to, the county in which the rally is held. The analysis of spillover effects separately estimates the ATT for counties with different treatment exposures. This Figure displays how spillover effects are handled in our setting, with three example treatments, in three counties. The counties are considered directly treated (red) if they hold a rally, treated as a first-degree neighbor if adjacent to the rally, as a second-degree neighbor if one county away from the treated county, and as a third-degree neighbor if two counties away from the treated county. The treated county adopts its minimum treated status; that is, if a county is both a second- and first-degree neighbor, it is estimated as a first-degree neighbor.](plotting/figures_supporting/s52.svg){#fig-s52}

The balance scores are, on average over the matching window, within the threshold of 0.1, indicating sufficient similarity between the treated and matched counties for the estimated ATTs. 132 treated counties remain, out of 159 counties in GA, with 563 matched control counties.](plotting/figures_supporting/s81.svg){#fig-s81}

![Overall estimates for the GA election, on the case rate, epi specification. Generally, we observed no statistically significant increase, on average, for treated counties from a period of 10 to 40 days after the election was held for either outcome. (a) Overall "average treatment effect on the treated" (ATT) estimates for the political events, representing the average difference in the change in case rates, from the day before treatment to 10 to 40 days after an election. The error bars indicate the 95% CIs. (b) Covariate balance. The balance scores reflect the similarity between the treated units and their matched counties for 30 days before up to 1 day before a political event. They reflect the covariate balance after matching refinement and the application of a caliper to ensure match quality.
